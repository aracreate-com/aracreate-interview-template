# Full Stack Software Engineer
## Objective | Evaluation:
As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you'll put your skills to demonstrate your ability to develop robust, scalable, and user-friendly applications from proof of concept to production. 

First of all, we expect a team member — who aspires to be a part of creating disruptive innovations in Germany — to be agile, technology-agnostic, flexible, and comply with best practices, guidelines and quality standards. We are not interested in someone who works in a silo and develops only a black box of working code.

Therefore, the first milestone of this challenge assesses your current skills as a full-stack software engineer based on your experience. Feel free to showcase your creativity and innovative thinking when developing the solution. 

After the evaluation, if you still need to include something from our expectations, we will mentor you with our standards and provide you with the second milestone to assess your ability to unlearn and relearn to fulfil the requirements.


## Problem Statement:

### Milestone 1:
#### Time Tracking
- Implement functionality for users to start and stop timers to track their work hours accurately.
#### Timeline
- 1 week
#### Estimation
- Should be provided the interviewee

### Milestone 2:
#### Dashboard
- Create a dashboard where users can view an overview of their tracked time, including total hours worked and recent time entries.
#### Timeline
- 1 week
#### Estimation
- Should be provided the interviewee

## Requirements:
- Design an architecture for the solution and list the stories, features and tasks first.
- Choose a development environment and application running on a UNIX-like operating system (Linux or macOS).
- Use a modern web development stack for your choice.
- Ensure the application has a professional UI and responsive design.
- Implement API for communication between the frontend and backend components.
- Utilise a database system for storing user data and time entries.
- Choose the appropriate toolchain to streamline development.
- Deploy the application to any free cloud platform and provide a link for live demo access.
- Write clean, well-documented code following best practices and coding standards.
- Commit your files to the provided GitHub repository.
- Update README.md with instructions for setting up and running the project locally, detailing the project overview, technical stack used, installation instructions, and other relevant information.
- Use the provided GitHub Project for project management (tasks, issues, time estimation).
- Track the working hours of every task in this project using another time-tracking tool.
