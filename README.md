# Full Stack Software Engineer
## Objective | Evaluation:
As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, you'll demonstrate your ability to develop robust, scalable, and user-friendly applications from PoC to Production. 

First of all, we expect a team member — who aspires to be a part of creating disruptive innovations made in Germany — to be agile, technology-agnostic, flexible, and comply with our best practices, guidelines and quality standards. 

So we are not interested in anyone who works in a silo, is limited to specific technologies, develops a black box system and is non-compliant with our guidelines and regulations. 

Therefore, the first milestone assesses your current skills based on your prior experience. When developing the solution, feel free to showcase your creativity and innovative thinking.

After the evaluation, if you still need to include something from our expectations, we will mentor you with our standards and provide you with the second milestone to assess your ability to unlearn and relearn to fulfil the requirements.

## Problem Statement:
Your challenge is to develop a simple time-tracking solution that allows users to track their work hours. The application should include the following features:

### Milestone 1:
#### Time Tracking
- Implement functionality for users to start and stop timers to track their work hours accurately.

### Milestone 2:
#### Dashboard
- Create a dashboard where users can view an overview of their tracked time, including total hours worked and recent time entries.

## Requirements:
- Use the provided GitHub Project for project management (tasks, issues, time estimation, timeline) and the GitHub repository for source management.
  - Notice the defined timeline for the respective milestones. If you need more time, let us know.
  - Enter all the expected features, tasks, and estimations before starting the development.
  - Commit your changes iteratively with the standard or conventional commit message.
  - Commit all relevant files, such as drawings, images, datasheets, credentials, etc.
  - Use the comments sections of the issue tracker for any questions by tagging @AravinthPanch and @KaminiVelusamy
  - Keep track of working hours consumed for every task in a sheet.
- Design an architecture for the required solution.
- Choose a development environment, build toolchains, and test applications running on a UNIX-like operating system (Linux or macOS).
- Use a modern web development stack.
- Ensure the application has a professional UI and responsive design.
- Implement API for communication between the frontend and backend components.
- Utilise a database system to store user data and time entries.
- Choose the appropriate toolchain to streamline development.
- Deploy the application to any free cloud platform and provide a link for live demo access.
- Write clean, well-documented code following best practices and coding standards.
- Update README.md with instructions for setting up and running the project locally, detailing the project overview, technical stack used, installation instructions, images of UI and other relevant information.

# Embedded Systems Engineer
## Objective | Evaluation:
As an Embedded Systems Engineer, you'll use your skills to demonstrate your ability to integrate hardware, firmware and software components to develop reliable, compliant and manufacturable embedded systems from PoC to Production.

First of all, we expect a team member — who aspires to be a part of creating disruptive innovations made in Germany — to be agile, technology-agnostic, flexible, and comply with our best practices, guidelines and quality standards. 

So we are not interested in anyone who works in a silo, is limited to specific technologies, develops a black box system and is non-compliant with our guidelines and regulations. 

Therefore, the first milestone assesses your current skills based on your prior experience. When developing the solution, feel free to showcase your creativity and innovative thinking.

After the evaluation, if you still need to include something from our expectations, we will mentor you with our standards and provide you with the second milestone to assess your ability to unlearn and relearn to fulfil the requirements.

## Problem Statement:
Your challenge is to develop a simple wireless device that allows users to trigger a defined action by pressing a button. The device should include the following features:

### Milestone 1:
#### Hardware:
- Design a circuit with a microcontroller, BLE, WiFi, a push button, and a power supply over USB.
- Build a prototype of the device on a protoboard (not breadboard) and have soldered fixed connections. 

#### Firmware:
- Develop a hardware abstraction layer for the firmware to integrate all components.
- Develop a data layer for the firmware to send/broadcast the button status via BLE.

### Milestone 2:
#### Dashboard:
- Connect the device to a simple cloud dashboard via WiFi to view the status of the button presses in real-time.

## Requirements:
- Use the provided GitHub Project for project management (tasks, issues, time estimation, timeline) and the GitHub repository for source management.
  - Notice the defined timeline for the respective milestones. If you need more time, let us know.
  - Enter all the expected features, tasks, and estimations before starting the development.
  - Commit your changes iteratively with the standard or conventional commit message.
  - Commit all relevant files, such as drawings, images, datasheets, credentials, etc.
  - Use the comments sections of the issue tracker for any questions by tagging @AravinthPanch and @KaminiVelusamy
- Design an architecture for the required solution and draw a schematic diagram for circuit wiring.
- Choose a development environment, build toolchains, and test applications running on a UNIX-like operating system (Linux or macOS).
- Utilise appropriate hardware components and modern embedded solutions. 
- Implement firmware using C/C++ and choose the appropriate toolchain to streamline development.
- Write clean, well-documented code following best practices and coding standards.
- Use any cloud platform and provide a link for live demo access.
- Update README.md with instructions for setting up and running the project locally, detailing the project overview, technical stack used, installation instructions, images of prototype and other relevant information.
